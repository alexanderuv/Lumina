## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: How should the system respond when a resize operation hits min/max constraints? ‚Üí A: Platform-native behavior (may differ per OS)
- Q: What automated test coverage is required for cross-platform parity validation? ‚Üí A: Unit tests + manual QA verification
- Q: Can multiple windows exist simultaneously per application instance? ‚Üí A: Yes - with platform-specific limits
- Q: How should the system handle rapid event flooding (e.g., 10,000 mouse events/sec)? ‚Üí A: Platform-native behavior (may differ per OS)
- Clarification: Unit tests will be written for discrete, testable components (no arbitrary coverage percentage targets)
- Q: What happens when the application loses focus or is minimized? ‚Üí A: Platform-native behavior (may differ per OS)
- Q: What happens during graceful vs forced application shutdown? ‚Üí A: Graceful allows cleanup, forced exits immediately

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A developer wants to create a cross-platform desktop application using Swift that can display a window, handle user input (keyboard and mouse), and adapt to different display scaling configurations on both macOS and Windows.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** no running application, **When** developer creates and runs a basic window app, **Then** a window appears on screen with a title and standard decorations

2. **Given** a running windowed application, **When** user types on keyboard or moves/clicks mouse, **Then** the application receives accurate input events with correct coordinates and key information

3. **Given** an application running on a display, **When** the window is moved to a monitor with different DPI scaling, **Then** the application receives scale change events and can query logical vs physical dimensions

4. **Given** a running event loop, **When** the application posts a custom user event, **Then** the event is delivered through the standard event processing pipeline

5. **Given** a running application in wait mode, **When** no user input occurs for extended periods, **Then** the application consumes minimal CPU while remaining responsive to new events

### Edge Cases
- When a window is resized to minimum or maximum constraints, platform-native behavior applies (may differ between macOS and Windows)
- Rapid event flooding (e.g., 10,000 mouse events/sec) follows platform-native behavior (may differ per OS)
- When application loses focus or is minimized, platform-native behavior applies (may differ per OS)
- Event ordering when multiple input types arrive simultaneously is platform-native (deferred to implementation)
- Graceful shutdown allows cleanup operations; forced shutdown exits immediately

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Event Loop & Application Lifecycle
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide three event loop modes: `run` (blocking), `poll` (non-blocking), and `wait` (low-power sleep until next event)
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow applications to post custom user events into the event queue
- **FR-003**: System MUST support graceful shutdown via system quit signal or explicit application exit
- **FR-004**: System MUST enforce single-threaded UI event loop execution
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent background threads from directly calling UI APIs
- **FR-033**: System MUST distinguish between graceful shutdown (allowing cleanup) and forced shutdown (immediate exit)

#### Window Management
- **FR-006**: System MUST support creating, showing, and closing windows
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow setting and modifying window title at runtime
- **FR-008**: System MUST support configurable window resizability with min/max size constraints
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide window visibility toggle (show/hide)
- **FR-010**: System MUST support programmatic window focus control
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow programmatic window repositioning and resizing
- **FR-032**: System MUST support multiple concurrent windows per application, subject to platform-specific limits

#### DPI & Display Scaling
- **FR-012**: System MUST distinguish between logical (device-independent) and physical (pixel) sizes
- **FR-013**: System MUST deliver scale factor change events when window moves between displays with different DPI
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide APIs to query current scale factor and convert between logical/physical coordinates

#### Pointer & Wheel Input
- **FR-015**: System MUST deliver pointer motion events with position in logical coordinates
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide pointer enter/leave events for window boundaries
- **FR-017**: System MUST support left, right, and middle mouse button press and release events
- **FR-018**: System MUST deliver vertical and horizontal scroll wheel events with precise delta values

#### Keyboard Input
- **FR-019**: System MUST deliver key down and key up events with keycodes
- **FR-020**: System MUST expose modifier key states (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Cmd/Win)
- **FR-021**: System MUST provide UTF-8 text input events for Latin keyboard layouts

#### System Cursors
- **FR-022**: System MUST provide standard cursor types: arrow, I-beam, crosshair, resize handles, and hand/pointer
- **FR-023**: System MUST support programmatic cursor visibility control (show/hide)

#### Cross-Platform Parity
- **FR-024**: All features MUST exhibit identical behavior and event ordering on both macOS and Windows
- **FR-025**: Event dispatch latency MUST average under 2 milliseconds
- **FR-026**: System MUST provide explicit error types via Result or typed exceptions
- **FR-031**: Cross-platform parity MUST be validated via unit tests for discrete, testable components plus manual QA verification on both platforms

#### Documentation & Examples
- **FR-027**: System MUST include "Hello Window" example demonstrating basic window creation
- **FR-028**: System MUST include "Input Explorer" example displaying all pointer and keyboard events
- **FR-029**: System MUST include "Scaling Demo" example showing logical vs physical size handling
- **FR-030**: All public APIs MUST have reference documentation

### Key Entities

- **Application**: Represents the running application instance with event loop control and lifecycle management; can manage multiple windows subject to platform limits
- **Window**: A platform window with attributes (title, size, position, visibility, focus state) and resizing constraints; multiple instances can coexist per application
- **Event**: Base type for all events processed by the event loop (window events, input events, user events, system events)
- **PointerEvent**: Mouse/trackpad input with position, button state, and enter/leave tracking
- **KeyboardEvent**: Key press/release with keycode, modifiers, and text input for character entry
- **ScaleFactorEvent**: Notification of DPI/scaling changes with old and new scale factors
- **LogicalSize / PhysicalSize**: Distinct types for device-independent vs pixel-based dimensions
- **Cursor**: System cursor appearance and visibility state
