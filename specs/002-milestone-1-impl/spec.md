## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-20
- Q: For event delivery (FR-004 "deterministic order"), what is the acceptable maximum latency from OS event generation to application callback? ‚Üí A: < 1ms (hard real-time gaming/CAD applications)
- Q: What is the maximum number of concurrent windows that must be supported per application instance? ‚Üí A: Unlimited (bounded only by system memory)
- Q: What level of diagnostic logging/telemetry should the framework provide for debugging and monitoring? ‚Üí A: Configurable levels (app controls verbosity: off/error/info/debug/trace)
- Q: When the event queue reaches capacity (high event rate exceeds processing speed), what should happen? ‚Üí A: Unbounded queue (may exhaust memory under sustained load)
- Q: What minimum test coverage percentage is required to consider this milestone complete? ‚Üí A: No specific percentage (functional acceptance only) - unit test all discrete, logic-only components thoroughly; platform-dependent code tested manually
- Q: Beyond clipboard operations (which are explicitly thread-safe per FR-053), what is the general thread safety model for the framework's APIs? ‚Üí A: @MainActor (Swift concurrency model)
- Q: How should the framework communicate errors to application developers when operations fail (e.g., window creation fails, clipboard access denied, monitor enumeration error)? ‚Üí A: Swift throwing functions with typed Error enum (recoverable errors); fatalError for programming mistakes
- Q: For runtime capability queries (FR-033, edge case line 112), what granularity should the framework provide for applications to check platform feature availability? ‚Üí A: Capability groups (WindowCapabilities, ClipboardCapabilities, etc.) with per-feature boolean queries within each group; uniform naming conventions
- Q: Should Milestone 1 include support for Input Method Editors (IMEs) needed for international text input (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, etc.)? ‚Üí A: No - Latin-only for M1; IME deferred to future milestone

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an application developer, I need to build cross-platform windowing applications that work identically on Linux (X11 and Wayland), macOS, and Windows, with robust window management, input handling, and system integration capabilities. The application must handle high-DPI displays correctly, provide reliable redraw mechanisms, and integrate with system features like clipboards and multi-monitor setups.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Wave A: Linux Platform Parity

1. **Given** the Lumina framework is available on a Linux system with X11, **When** a developer creates a window with title, size constraints, and resizable properties, **Then** the window displays correctly with all properties honored by the window manager

2. **Given** the Lumina framework is available on a Linux system with Wayland, **When** a developer creates the same windowing application, **Then** the window displays identically to the X11 version (within compositor limitations)

3. **Given** a window is displayed on a high-DPI Linux monitor (2.0x scale factor), **When** the window renders content, **Then** content appears sharp and scales correctly, and the application can query the current scale factor

4. **Given** a window is running on Linux, **When** the user moves the mouse, clicks buttons, scrolls, and types on the keyboard, **Then** the application receives all input events in the correct order with accurate modifiers and coordinates

5. **Given** a Linux application with multiple windows, **When** the user posts custom events from background threads, **Then** events are delivered to the correct windows in deterministic order

#### Wave B: macOS Robustness & System Integration

6. **Given** a macOS application requires precise frame rendering, **When** the application requests a redraw or the system determines rendering is needed, **Then** the application receives explicit RedrawRequested events with optional dirty region information

7. **Given** a macOS application running animations, **When** the application switches control flow modes (Wait, Poll, or WaitUntil), **Then** the event loop behaves according to the selected mode with appropriate power consumption and timing precision

8. **Given** a macOS window, **When** the developer toggles decorations, enables transparency, or sets always-on-top behavior, **Then** the window appearance updates immediately with platform-appropriate rendering

9. **Given** a macOS application, **When** the application reads or writes text to the clipboard, **Then** clipboard operations complete successfully and interoperate with native macOS applications, with thread-safe access

10. **Given** a macOS system with multiple monitors, **When** the application queries monitor information, **Then** it receives accurate geometry, work areas, and scale factors for all displays, and is notified when the configuration changes

### Edge Cases

#### Linux-Specific Edge Cases
- What happens when a Wayland compositor doesn't support required protocols (e.g., fractional scaling)?
  - System must detect missing capabilities and either gracefully degrade or provide clear error messages

- What happens when moving a window between monitors with different scale factors on X11?
  - System must emit scale change events and allow the application to re-render at the new scale factor

- What happens when different X11 window managers have varying EWMH compliance?
  - System must use lowest-common-denominator features and document known window manager quirks

- What happens when a user runs a Wayland application but Wayland display server is not available?
  - System must detect environment and either fall back to X11 or provide clear error about missing Wayland support

#### macOS-Specific Edge Cases
- What happens when rapid window resizing occurs during a live resize operation?
  - System must coalesce redraw events to prevent redundant rendering

- What happens when clipboard is accessed from a non-main thread?
  - System must marshal clipboard calls to the main thread or fail with clear thread safety error

- What happens when a window moves between standard and ProMotion (120Hz) displays?
  - System must adjust frame pacing for the new refresh rate

- What happens when system monitor configuration changes while application is running (monitor connected/disconnected)?
  - System must emit monitor configuration change events with updated monitor list

#### Cross-Platform Edge Cases
- What happens when the same application code runs on all three platforms?
  - Wave A features must behave identically (window creation, input, DPI) across macOS, Windows, and Linux

- What happens when a feature is available on one platform but not another?
  - System must provide runtime capability queries organized by category (WindowCapabilities, ClipboardCapabilities, MonitorCapabilities, etc.) with per-feature boolean checks so applications can adapt behavior

#### Resource Exhaustion Edge Cases
- What happens when event rate exceeds processing speed (e.g., 10,000 events/sec)?
  - System uses unbounded queue; events accumulate in memory until processed or memory exhaustion occurs
  - Application is responsible for monitoring event processing latency and adapting event generation rate

### Key Entities

- **Window**: Represents an application window with properties like title, size, position, visibility, focus state, decorations, and transparency. Belongs to a single application and resides on one monitor at a time.

- **Event**: Represents system or user actions (window events, input events, redraw requests, custom user events). Contains timestamp, window identifier, and event-specific data (coordinates, modifiers, etc.).

- **Monitor**: Represents a physical display device with geometry (position, dimensions), work area, scale factor, and primary/secondary designation. Can host multiple windows.

- **Scale Factor**: Represents the DPI scaling multiplier for rendering (1.0x, 1.5x, 2.0x, etc.). Associated with monitors and used to convert between logical and physical pixel coordinates.

- **Backend**: Represents the platform-specific implementation layer (X11, Wayland, macOS Cocoa, Windows Win32). Provides windowing, input, and system integration capabilities.

- **Clipboard**: Represents the system clipboard for text data exchange. Supports read/write operations and ownership tracking for interoperability with native applications.
